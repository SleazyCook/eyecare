The doctor knew everything about what bothered me about my eyes without my even having to open my mouth. Dude is good! and funny too. The receptionist is very personable and clearly cares about the patients, she put a lot of effort into helping me get my insurance situation sorted out, and never once made me feel like it was a bother. Ill be doing all my exams here from now on."

        message: "This is by far the best eye place! The Dr is the kindest and he always tries to get to the bottom of the issue instead of focusing on just making money off of you. Also, when I called the drs office, they had closed already so I got no answer. I didn't leave a voicemail or anything. That very next morning, they called me back! That's good business!  I'll for sure never go anywhere else!"
